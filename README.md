# Usagi's Kitchen

Don’t have any ideas what to cook? Ask the bunny!

An app to help you out when you have suddenly forgot all the food you have ever enjoyed and are just standing in front of the fridge thinking about what dinner should be. 

Built mainly for practicing JavaScript and randomized arrays (also a first trial for SCSS) but I ended up having way more fun with this than expected. Hope you will have too! 💖


## Features  ✨

- 🐇 An adorable bunny whose facial expression changes with every refresh 
- 🍩 Filterable recipes for categories (dinner, dessert, pasta, soup, etc) and main ingredient
- 🍽️ You can check the main ingredients for each individual recipes
- 🥪 Random recommendations when no filters are selected
- 🍓 Fully responsive
- 🧹 Also reminds you to keep your space tidy
